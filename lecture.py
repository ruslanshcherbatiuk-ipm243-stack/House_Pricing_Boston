st.markdown("""
In the rapidly evolving field of data science and analytics, the tools and platforms we use to explore data, build models,
and share insights are critical to our success and efficiency.

__Jupyter Notebooks__ have long been a staple in the data professional's toolkit, offering a convenient and interactive environment for code,visualization, and narrative.
However, as the demands for more dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly data applications grow, the limitations of Jupyter Notebooks in creating shareable,
production-ready applications become apparent.

Jupyter Notebooks are excellent for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, and educational purposes.
They provide a linear, cell-based interface where code, outputs, and markdown notes coexist, making them ideal for storytelling with data.
However, when it comes to turning these explorations into interactive web applications that can be easily shared with non-technical users, notebooks fall short.
They are not designed for creating standalone web applications, lack interactivity out of the box, and require substantial work to deploy in a user-friendly format.

This is where frameworks like `Streamlit`, `Dash`, and `Panel` come into play, offering powerful alternatives for building and deploying data applications. They empower users to transform complex datasets into userâ€”friendly web applications, whether mere numbers or intricate charts.

The beauty of these technologies is that they not only allow experts to analyze and visualize data but enable anyone, regardless of their technical expertise,
to interact with and grasp the insights presented. So, if you want to showcase your data engaging and comprehensibly, these tools offer the perfect palette.

st.header("Streamlit Widgets")
st.subheader("Displaying text")
st.markdown("""
Streamlit has several widgets for displaying text, for example:

* `st.text` displays fixed-width and preformatted text
* `st.markdown` shows markdown text
* `st.latex` displays mathematical expressions formatted as LaTex
* `st.write` behaves differently depending on the inputs given to it. For example:
    * when you pass a Pandas DataFrame to it, it prints the data frame as a table
    * displays information about a function when a function is passed to it
    * displays a Keras model when one is passed to it
* `st.title` displays text in title formatting
* `st.header` displays text in header formatting
* `st.code` displays code
* `with st.echo()` displays the code after it as well as runs it.

> Note: most of the time you can use `write` instead of any other displaying function for text and data.

You have already seen most of the text widgets in action, but here's a more condensed example and code to copy:

Streamlit also has widgets that let users interact with your application, for example:

* you can use the select box to let the user choose between several options (say, enable the user to filter data depending on a certain category)
* the multi-select widget is similar to the select box, but allows multiple selections
* the text area and text input widgets can be used to collect user input
* the date and time input can be used to collect time and date input
* you can also let users upload files using the file uploader widget
 (this can come in handy when you've built an image classifier or object detection model, and want users to upload images and see the result)

When building your application, it's always good practice to show user progress or some status.
For example, when loading a large dataset, you can show a progress bar.

Some other status and progress widgets that you can use in Streamlit include:

* `st.spinner()` displays a temporary message when executing a block of code
* `st.balloons()` shows celebratory balloons
* `st.error()` displays an error message
* `st.warning` shows a warning message
* `st.info` shows informational messages
* `st.success` shows success messages 
* `st.exception` communicates an exception in your application
